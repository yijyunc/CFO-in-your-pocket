### **Speed Over Perfection**
Better to have approximate insights immediately than perfect analysis that takes hours to generate.

### **Context Over Raw Data**
Numbers without context are just noise. Every metric includes benchmarks, trends, and recommendations.

The goal isn't to create beautiful charts - it's to help founders make better financial decisions faster.
